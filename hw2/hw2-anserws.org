* BPE Tokenizer
** A: Counterexamples
*** Injective
*** Invertible
*** Preserves concatenation
** B: Why is it generally impossible to build non-trivial rokenizers that preserve concatenation
Because preserving concatenation implies that concatenation of letter by letter cocatenation is that same as concatenation of the letters. Thus, tokenise("Then") = tokenise("T") + tokenise("h") + tokenise("e") + tokenise("n"). Thus, tokenisation has to be some representation of the alphabet.
